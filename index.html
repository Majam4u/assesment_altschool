                    A complete training indeed is a great blessing, I would thank the AltSchool team for putting up such a great Diploma Programme. 
                    <br>
                    Hence, my personal expectations are really high and full of enthusiasm to learn and progress into an exciting career, one in which I have always envisaged in order to solve real life problems. 
                    <br>
                    Some of my expectations from the training sessions could be best summarized below:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>It should make me gain more than average insights on my capabilities.</li>
                        <li>It should help me learn new things and make me comfortable to adopt the technicality. </li>
                        <li>It should help me with the technical-know-how on emerging technologies, especially in frontend engineering. </li>
                        <li>It should come with the experience of having to work in a community and benefits of having to learn and blend with team mates when it is a group task.</li>
                        <li>It should put me in a good position to judge myself at the end of the training program on how far I have gone in Frontend Development. </li>
                    </ol>   
                <br>
